# CPU-16bit


This project models a 16 bit single-cycle CPU using Verilog. The complete list of the instruction it supports and the detailed explanation of its components and their interaction can be found in the pdf files: [Detyra2-AK-2022.pdf](https://github.com/arbreshaejupi/CPU-16bits/files/9494894/Detyra2-AK-2022.pdf),
